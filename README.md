<h1>Mixed Effects Models for Nonnormal Responses</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is based off of the textbook "Extending the Linear Model with R" by Julian J. Faraway. These are exercises completed based off of Chapter 13: Mixed Effects Models for Nonnormal Responses. In this exercise 6 methods are used to fit the same data: Binomial GLM, GLMM using penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL), Gaussian-Hermite quadrature, INLA, STAN, and GEE. They are ultimately compared and determined which models are the best fit. Further analysis is computed on Generalized Estimating Equations using geepack.
